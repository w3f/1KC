## Introduction

The Technical Education and Support teams of Web3 Foundation, along with the Community team 
at Parity Technologies offer an off-chain contributor program to support and fund community 
contributions. As part of our commitment to promoting the WEB3 ecosystem, this program focuses on 
funding contributions in the areas of **technical education**, **community** and 
**support** that relates to the Polkadot ecosystem.

The program, One Thousand Contributors Programme or 1KC for short, takes motivation from the 
[Thousand Validators Programme (1KV)](https://github.com/w3f/1k-validators-be) and the 
[Web3 Foundation Grants Program](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program).

> The 1KC program is managed by the Technical Education & Support teams of Web3 Foundation.
> For more information about Web3 Foundation, please visit the [About page](https://web3.foundation/about/) 
> on our website.

## How to Participate

You can signal your intent to participate by: 

1. Choosing a task from this [list](https://github.com/orgs/w3f/projects/13) of open tasks,
2. Then filling out this [typeform](https://form.typeform.com/to/I9vjnCcI)

### Process

Once you have submitted your contribution proposal, the team will:

1. Evaluate. Your [evaluators](#1kc-evaluators) will differ depending on which area you want to contribute.
2. Accept or deny. Once we review your proposal, we will get in touch with you about the status.
3. Define your delivery. All tasks will have different delivery requirements; we will communicate what your 
contribution needs to fulfill.
4. Funding. Once both parties finalize the delivery of the task, the team will deposit your rewards to the account
shared with us.

### Submission reviews

The review process follows the present pipeline in the [1KC public GitHub project](https://github.com/orgs/w3f/projects/13).

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Pilot

*Pilot the program with limited conditions*

- Discover and understand the bottlenecks of this program.
- Contributors of varying backgrounds and levels of expertise can submit contributions. These contributions 
will be subject to compliance with established guidelines outlined in this document and high levels of scrutiny.

The team initially launched the program as a pilot program, where tasks are outlined by Web3 Foundation and made 
publicly.

The team uses this program as an off-chain reward mechanism to reward specific contributions from 
the community. We believe this is supplementary to the on-chain treasury and bounties, which don't reward 
specific contributions easily. See [Alternative Funding Sources](#alternative-funding-sources) for more details on 
traditional funding methods.

> However, the program also serves as an opportunity to encourage contributions in the areas of technical 
> education, community, and support for the Polkadot ecosystem.

**Target Audience**: Ambassadors that are part of the [Polkadot 
Ambassador Programme](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/ambassadors) and active ecosystem members.

The purpose of this is to test out the program through active community members and reward existing contributors.

### Phase 2: Scale

*Scale the program with greater conditions*

- Apply improvements based on lessons from the pilot program.
- Extend the program to the general community.
- Create an official landing page.
- Increase funding amount.

After the pilot program, the team intends to scale this to a grants-proposal model, where the community can 
propose new ideas. 

**Target Audience**: All types of Polkadot community members.

### Phase 3: Decentralize

*Decentralize the program with modified conditions*

The program starts small with the goal to learn as we go. We aim to decentralize
the 1KC programme by moving the program on-chain. 

> We hope you will be excited to help us develop this program further with the same intent in mind.

**Target Audience**: The entire Polkadot ecosystem.

## 1KC Evaluators

1KC Evaluators are individuals able to evaluate the contribution delivered from the Contributors Programme. 

- Supervisor: [Bill Laboon](https://github.com/laboon)
- Technical Education: 
  - [Radhakrishna Dasari](https://github.com/DrW3RK): Media related contributions 
  - [Emre Surmeli](https://github.com/emresurmeli): Communinty related contributions
  - [Danny Salman](https://github.com/DannyS03): Documentation related contributions
- Support: 
  - [Michalis Fragkiadakis](https://github.com/michalisFr): Support related contributions

The 1KC evaluators will reach out to Subject Matter Experts within Web3 Foundation where a niche expert opinion 
is desirable. As the program is currently in a pilot model, an official committee will be established when the 
time is appropriate.
 
## Alternative Funding Sources
 
We encourage you to explore the alternative funding options listed below. Please note, however, that you should 
not seek to fund the same work from multiple sources. Anyone found doing so will be terminated from 1KC program.

### Treasury

The treasury is a pot of on-chain funds collected through transaction fees, slashing, staking inefficiencies, etc. 
The funds held in the treasury can be spent on spending proposals. Both [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/) and 
[Kusama](https://kusama.network/) offer everyone the opportunity to apply for funding via the treasury.
